			     ~~~~~~~~~


DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This utility is designed to reformat the output of smodels, in order to put one
atom per line. Additionally, it strips off all statistics. Models are separated
by a line containing the word "::endmodel".


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a precompiled binary exists for your system, just copy it to a directory in
your $PATH (typically, in the directory where lparse and smodels reside). You
can make sure that the program is executable by executing

% cd [path to MKAtoms]
% chmod a+rx mkatoms

You may also want to download the getone and getall scripts (see below). Just
repeat the above steps for each of them.

If no precompiled binary is available for your system, you have to download the
source package, uncompress and untar it, then execute:

% cd MKAtoms
% ./configure
% make all
% make install

This will install MKAtoms, getone and getall in /usr/local/bin. If you want to 
select a different location, specify a different prefix when you run "configure",
as follows:

% ./configure --prefix=/path/where/you/want/MKAtoms/installed

Notice that you will probably need root access to the system in order to install
in /usr/local/bin.


USAGE
~~~~~~

mkatoms acts as a filter, i.e. the output of smodels can be directly piped into
mkatoms as follows:

% lparse [input files and options] | smodels [options] | mkatoms

Alternatively, mkatoms may take its input from a file, as follows:

% mkatoms < [file containing the output of smodels]

For UNIX installations, two scripts are available to make the above calls
simpler.

% getone [lparse input files and options]

invokes lparse, smodels and mkatoms and returns only the first model found.

% getall [lparse input files and options]

invokes lparse, smodels and mkatoms and returns all models found.
